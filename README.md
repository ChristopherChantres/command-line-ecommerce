# Command Line E-commerce System

A Java-based command line e-commerce application that simulates an online store with separate interfaces for buyers and sellers.

## Overview

OnlineDeal is a command line application that simulates a complete e-commerce system. The application supports two types of users - buyers and sellers - and provides different functionalities for each. Buyers can browse products, add them to their cart, make purchases, and manage their accounts. Sellers can add new products, view their inventory, track sales, and manage their accounts.
